# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Mist intensity / fan-speed levels (capture changing the level to map values).
- LED light control.
- Device on-board schedules (opcode 0x5716) once the field layout is mapped from
  targeted captures; HA automations against the switches are recommended meanwhile.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- Avoid a ~30s delay (and HA service timeout) when sending a command: only the
  vendor `0xFFFx` characteristics are used now. Previously the code also tried to
  subscribe to the standard Service Changed characteristic (`0x2a05`), whose
  notify-subscribe blocked for 30s before failing. Confirmed: `fff2` is the write
  characteristic (handle 0x12) and `fff1` the notify characteristic (handle 0x17),
  matching the original packet capture.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- **Switches did nothing on the real device.** Characteristic auto-detection
  classified the vendor `0xFFFx` control characteristics (FFF1..FFF4, expressed
  in the standard Bluetooth base form) as non-vendor, so commands were written to
  a generic GATT characteristic and ignored. Vendor detection now recognises the
  `0xFF00-0xFFFF` proprietary range, and the device layer subscribes to all
  candidate notify characteristics and tries each candidate write characteristic,
  keeping whichever returns a state report (and caching it for next time).

## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- Local brand images in `custom_components/aromadd/brand/` (`icon.png`,
  `icon@2x.png`, `logo.png`, `logo@2x.png`) so the integration icon shows in the
  Home Assistant UI. This is the supported method for custom integrations as of
  HA 2026.3; the home-assistant/brands repo no longer accepts custom integrations.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- **Control failure** (`BleakCharacteristicNotFoundError: Characteristic 18 was
  not found`). The integration wrote by raw GATT handle (`0x12`), but handle
  numbers differ between BLE stacks, so the handle from the phone capture did not
  resolve on the Home Assistant host. The write/notify characteristics are now
  discovered from the live GATT table at connect time (handle hint first, then a
  writable/notifiable + vendor-service fallback).
- Silenced a `SyntaxWarning` from the escape sequence in `const.py`'s docstring.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- **Critical:** removed the invalid Bluetooth `local_name` matcher `"U5*"`. A
  wildcard in the first three characters is rejected by Home Assistant and caused
  the core `bluetooth` component to fail to set up, cascading to every
  Bluetooth-dependent integration (esphome, bluetooth_adapters, bermuda, bedjet,
  ibeacon, etc.). Remaining matchers (`"U5 Pro*"`, `"Aromadd*"`) are valid.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Fan** switch (opcode 0x5703): ON payload `570310`, OFF payload `570300`,
  confirmed via state report `5303 xx`. Separate from the main Power switch.

### Changed
- Refactored the BLE device layer to handle multiple controls; the switch
  platform is now description-driven (Power + Fan).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-16

First public release. Bluetooth LE control of the Aromadd U5 Pro diffuser.

### Added
- `switch` entity for on/off control of the Aromadd U5 Pro.
- Device-confirmed state: each command is verified against the diffuser's own
  state-report notification (`53 08 01` / `53 08 00`) rather than assumed.
- Automatic Bluetooth discovery plus a manual device-picker config flow.
- Connect → write → confirm → disconnect handling so the official Aromadd app can
  still reconnect.
- Reverse-engineered BLE protocol from an HCI snoop log:
  frame `A5 AA AC | XOR(payload) | <payload> | C5 CC CA`; commands written to GATT
  handle `0x0012`, state reported via notifications on handle `0x0017`.
- HACS packaging: `hacs.json`, brand assets, and a `validate.yaml` workflow running
  the HACS Action and hassfest.

### Known limitations
- On/off only; mist level, LED, and timers are not yet implemented.
- Changes made with the physical button or phone app while Home Assistant is not
  connected are not pushed back to HA.
